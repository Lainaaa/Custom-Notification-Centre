# Custom Notification Centre ðŸ””

Lightweight notification center implementation for Swift using observer pattern.

## Features
- âœ¨ Simple observer registration and removal
- ðŸ“¢ Event broadcasting to multiple observers  
- ðŸ§¹ Automatic memory management
- âš¡ Lightweight and fast

## Usage
```swift
// Add observer
CustomNotificatinCenter.shared.addObserver(observer: self, name: "moneyReceived") {
    print("Money received!")
}

// Post notification
CustomNotificatinCenter.shared.post(name: "moneyReceived")

// Remove observer
CustomNotificatinCenter.shared.removeObserver(observer: self, name: "moneyReceived")
```

## Example Output
```
ðŸ“¢ First announcement - all companies are subscribed:
Lidership: we got more money!
Audi: Give money to Audi, we will make new electric audi!
Porsche: Just give money to Porsche
Volkswagen: Give money to Volkswagen, we will make cheap car for people!

ðŸ’° Porsche receives money and unsubscribes:
Porsche received money!

ðŸ“¢ Second announcement - Porsche should NOT respond:
Lidership: we got more money!
Audi: Give money to Audi, we will make new electric audi!
Volkswagen: Give money to Volkswagen, we will make cheap car for people!

ðŸ’° Audi receives money and unsubscribes:
Audi received money!

ðŸ“¢ Third announcement - only Volkswagen should respond:
Lidership: we got more money!
Volkswagen: Give money to Volkswagen, we will make cheap car for people!
```

> âœ¨ **Demonstration**: Notice how after each company receives money and unsubscribes, they stop responding to future announcements. This shows the notification center correctly removes observers.
